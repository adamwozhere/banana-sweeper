# banana-sweeper

minesweeper, but with bananas.

TODO:

- Lots
- Refactor everything
- Decide whether to keep using data attributes or have the board hold object hold all state such as marked, revealed cells etc.
  - Use a `cell` object that is put in board array?
  - Use `enum flags` to just keep storing a number in array?
- Better styling
